If someone leaves a comment comprised entirely of emoji, make it bigger.

== Description ==

It's all the rage.  If someone sends a message comprised of _just_ emoji, make it bigger!  Eye strain is dangerous!

Shorter emoji messages get bigger than longer emoji messages, and you can include spaces between your emoji and it will still count.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
